What is more, we shall express my gratitude and apology to the illustrators of the raw images of the generals and cards, whose names are
presented in illustrators.xlsx. Since we do not have a single illustrator in our studio, we have to pick the pictures from Pixiv and some
other websites without being authorized. We are sorry for arbitrarily using those illustrators' works in this program, and we promise that
this program is never to be used for commercial purposes.
