For developers:

To build this project, a QT Library (5.5.1 and 5.6.1 tested, 4.x does not work) and a QT Creator (3.5.1 tested) are both needed.
Swig may be necessary as well in order to generate swig/sanguosha_wrap.cxx.
Make sure that swig/sanguosha_wrap.cxx exists, and then open the .pro file in QT Creator and build it.
